A Vagrantfile and some scripts for linking OctoberCMS and setting up a Vagrant VM.

##### This was written for a Linux environment, and only tested on Debian Jessie.

If you want to link an already-existing OctoberCMS project, you want the [link](https://github.com/nanohard/october_vagrant/tree/link) branch.

If you do not yet have OctoberCMS installed, you want the [install](https://github.com/nanohard/october_vagrant/tree/install) branch.

```
git clone git@github.com:nanohard/october_vagrant.git
git fetch
```
then...
```
git checkout link
OR
git checkout install
```
