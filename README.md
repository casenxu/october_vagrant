##### This was written for a Linux environment, and only tested on Debian Jessie.

If you want to link an already-existing OctoberCMS project, you want the "link" branch.

If you do not yet have OctoberCMS installed, you want the "install" branch.

```
git clone git@github.com:nanohard/october_vagrant.git
git fetch
```
then...
```
git checkout link
OR
git checkout install
```
